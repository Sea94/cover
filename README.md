Elderly people isolated at their homes during the COVID-19 crisis need an easy way to connect with volunteers available to provide rapid assistance because searching for help online is complicated while frequent requests to friends and relatives might be socially embarrassing.

## Inspiration
Almost 20% of Swiss population, belonging to [65+ age group](https://tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/population-ages-65-and-above-percent-of-total-wb-data.html), fall into high risk category according to [Covid-19 regulations](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/besonders-gefaehrdete-menschen.html). While a lot of volunteering services and support groups are emerging online, only [one third of elrderly people](https://www.mediachange.ch/media//pdf/publications/SummaryReport_WIP-CH_2019.pdf) have a chance to reach out to their services since many still restrain from "going online". Some volunteers follow more traditional ways to suggest assistance for their elderly neighbors and leave paper notes on pinboards in shared hallways. However, one or two volunteers per building might not be enough to handle all the requests efficiently, not to say that older neighbors may find it embarrassing to burden their youger counterparts too much.
