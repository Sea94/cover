# COVER

**Elderly** and ill people **isolated** at home need an easy way to connect with volunteers for **rapid assistance** as online help-seeking is hard while frequent requests to relatives cause social embarrassment.

To address the problem and offer protection for the population in need during Covid-19 crisis, we offer **COVER** â€• a service to connect people with COVid volunteERs via simple and centralized phone calls and sms.

## Inspiration
Almost 20% of the Swiss population, belonging to [65+ age group](https://tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/population-ages-65-and-above-percent-of-total-wb-data.html), fall into a high-risk category according to [Covid-19 regulations](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/besonders-gefaehrdete-menschen.html). While a lot of volunteering services and support groups are emerging on the Internet, only [one third of senior people](https://www.mediachange.ch/media//pdf/publications/SummaryReport_WIP-CH_2019.pdf) have a chance to reach out to their services since many still restrain from "going online".

Those who actually start searching for support on the world wide web may eventually get overwhelmed with an [abundance of means and resources](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_solidarity-initiatives-fight-virus-fallout-in-switzerland/45620290): numerous Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, websites, mobile applications and many more... It is difficult to decide whom to reach out in this choice overload.

Some volunteers follow more traditional ways to suggest assistance for their elderly neighbors and leave paper notes on pinboards in shared hallways. However, one or two volunteers per building might not be enough to handle all the requests efficiently, not to say that fellow-neighbors may find it [embarrassing to burden their younger or healthier counterparts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825742/) too much.

The competitive analysis map (attached in the gallery) shows how we find our project different from other existing solutions. COVER platform aims to rapidly connect elderly or sick people to volunteers without a mediator in between ensuring ease of use and reduced social embarrassment.

## What it does

This project aims to help elderly or sick people isolated at home and seeking for daily assistance (do grocery shopping, walk a dog, throw out trash, fix items, etc.). It aims to build a platform to connect these people with volunteers in the neighborhood ready to assist. The service allows a user to request help with SMS, phone call or through a web interface. The platform processes and sorts the requests according to their type. The volunteers available at the moment can accept a request and contact the person for further details. The requests are also displayed on a map for more convenience. The volunteer can receive notifications about new requests in the neighborhood on the fly, which facilitates and accelerates assistance.

## How I built it

To process incoming calls, we will use the [voximplant](https://voximplant.com/) service along with [dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) and a  python-flask backend server. We will provide an interactive frontend with Vue.js. 
The mobile app is likely to be written using the flutter framework.
